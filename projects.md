### Past

#### PyOEIS

PyOEIS is a Python module (written in Python 2.7) for interfacing with the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org).
It was my first real programming project, and as such contains much that I am now embarrassed by and I no longer maintain it. Nevertheless,
it still works on Python 2.7 and 3.x, and I'm quite proud of it.

#### Random Table Roller

Random Table Roller is a simple graphical program for rolling against random tables used in many tabletop RPGs. It accepts tables in a
simple CSV format and allows the user to load many tables upfront and switch between then easily.

### Ongoing

#### Webcomic tumblogs

I maintain automated Tumblr blogs which post new strips from the xkcd and Depressed Alien webcomics. The code is written in Python 2.7 and
runs on a Google App Engine instance. A rewrite may occur when GAE adds stable Python 3 support.
